## 1. No Alcohol! ‚úãüç∑üõë

This one sounds easy but for me, I have to admit, it is probably the most difficult one:

- Between the 21.11.2022 and the 21.12.2022 I will abstain from any alcoholic substance.

#### Why is it the most challenging part for me u ask?

Most friends of mine are like to drink there and now alcohol. It feels like our society is so focused on the fact that
drinking alcohol is the most common thing to do when going in the city or going on a party. When u refuse to drink
people almost always asking: "Ohh, why that? Everything O.K with you?". It is like u get blamed or something
similar...it makes it difficult to really mentally be and stay in the state of no drinking. And I will be honest here: I
am drinking way too much for my goals and my health. I even don't want to drink but my brain is so accustomed to
drinking regular alcohol, it just feels really like an automatism.

So yes, this is why...I'm not proud of it but that's the reason why I'm doing this, and I am looking forward to killing
this habit from my life - to get to the point where drinking some alcohol is an absolutely rare thing and maybe then
even a small thing and no hangover like these days.

## 2. Sport - Six times a week! üèÉ

Before you are going to jump out of the window, let me the number 'six' explain. Six times doesn't have to mean you have
to go enrage everyday day with your body. With my level of intensity it wouldn't be healthy. My goal is to get used to
do something every day. So this is the challenge:

- Between the 21.11.2022 and the 21.12.2022 I will do six times a week sport. This can be anything from running to
  crossfit to biking

---
To be able to do this I have to get used to train six times a week. So in this challenge I will give me an exception
under one term:

- If my muscles are not regenerate fast enough I am allowed to shift my intense to the lower part (e.g. reduce running
  speed/time).
- If I have an injury which forces me to lay down a session I am allowed to do so. But in this case I will, if my injury
  allows it, go out for a walk or something similar.

---

#### Why six times and how do they look?

My long term goal is to run a marathon. For this I need to run at least four times a week. In addition, I don't want to
get lost in running alone because strength matters to for daily health and maybe a little for the eye to. üòâ

So how could a week look like if my muscles are able to do regenerate enough between each day:

<ol>
<li>Crossfit    -> high intense</li>
<li>Running     -> low intense, long duration</li>
<li>Running     -> middle intense, short duration</li>
<li>Crossfit    -> high intense</li>
<li>Running     -> high intense, short duration</li>
<li>Running     -> really low intense, long duration (active rest)</li>
<li>Rest day</li>
</ol>
