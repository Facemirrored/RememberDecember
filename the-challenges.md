## 1. No Alcohol ‚úãüç∑üõë

This one sounds easy but for me, I have to admit, it is probably the most difficult one:

- Between the 21.11.2022 and the 21.12.2022 I will abstain from any alcoholic substance.

#### Why is it the most challenging part for me u ask?

Most friends of mine are like to drink there and now alcohol. It feels like our society is so focused on the fact that
drinking alcohol is the most common thing to do when going in the city or going on a party. When u refuse to drink
people almost always asking: "Ohh, why that? Everything O.K with you?". It is like u get blamed or something
similar...it makes it difficult to really mentally be and stay in the state of no drinking. And I will be honest here: I
am drinking way too much for my goals and my health. I even don't want to drink but my brain is so accustomed to
drinking regular alcohol, it just feels really like an automatism.

So yes, this is why...I'm not proud of it but that's the reason why I'm doing this, and I am looking forward to killing
this habit from my life - to get to the point where drinking some alcohol is an absolutely rare thing and maybe then
even a small thing and no hangover like these days.
