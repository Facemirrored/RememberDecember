# Welcome to Remember-December! üòä

This project is for personal purpose only. It is my goal first to document my challenge-goals which I will focus on
completion. This challenge is starting from the 21. November and will be ending at the 21. December.

## What specific Goals/Challenges? üí™

Each challenge is represented as ToDo in this documentation. Its order is simple! A small, theoretically simple, task
which I want to accomplish. Therefore, each task should be atomic from itself and the another tasks.

This assures that I really have to do each task separately and don't compromise me to make it easier by for-filling
multiple tasks at one.

At last there will be exact five tasks/challenges. Each task has to be completed each day.

- If a task cannot be accomplished per definition it has to be explained with logical good reasons.
- If a task cannot be accomplished due laziness or similar stupid excuses this Remember-December challenge has failed!

## Why all this u asking? üôÉ

Through the last months I was trying to get better in a lot of things like eating more healthy, getting used to do more
sport or invest some time in reading and social-media detox.

I have done some things I'm proud of but at the end I also have failed some...

So, now I'm sitting here at a sundays evening writing these lines to prepare me for my new goals. I want to have
something tangible, something I can hold on when I have to accomplished my goals.

Furthermore, those challenges are hard for me. I have failed them, not one time only. I know that this won't be easy for
me...and it shouldn't be - otherwise it wouldn't be a challenge. üòâ

## What now?

Now I - or you as stranger - can go to the next entries to read my experiences with this challenge. I will handle this
repository as a diary to protocol my little journey. Have fun stranger, have fun little me reading this in the future
and be proud of me due my success or be gentle and sincere when I have failed - in both cases I will learn something! ‚ù§Ô∏è
